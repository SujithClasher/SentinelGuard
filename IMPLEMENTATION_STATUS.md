## ⚠️ Needs Updates (Non-Critical)

### Screens with Old API References
These screens reference the old multi-child system but don't block the main demo flow:

1. **activity_reports_screen.dart**
   - References old `children` getter
   - Uses old `BrowseHistory` model properties
   - Used old `AppData.todayUsageMinutes` (renamed to `usageMinutes`)
   - **Impact**: Reports tab may have errors, but dashboard works
   - **Fix**: Update to use single device data from `AppState.device`

2. **child_profiles_screen.dart**
   - Entire screen for managing multiple children
   - **Impact**: Not linked in navigation anymore
   - **Status**: Can be deleted or ignored

3. **screen_time_management_screen.dart**
   - References `children` and `updateChildLimit`
   - **Impact**: Premium locked anyway
   - **Fix**: Update to use single device limits

4. **web_filtering_screen.dart**
   - Has some property mismatches (`blockedSitesCount` vs `blockedCount`)
   - **Impact**: Minor display issues, core functionality works
   - **Fix**: Update property names
