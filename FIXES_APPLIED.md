**Solution:**

  - `https://pornhub.com` ✅
  - Any URL with "pornhub" in it ✅

3. **RED BLOCK DIALOG APPEARS!** 🚫

**Location:** `lib/screens/parent/functional_web_filtering_screen.dart`

### 3. ✅ Can't Exit with Back Button - Must Use PIN!

**Problem:** Could press back button to exit kids launcher

**Solution:**
- Added `WillPopScope` to prevent back button
- Pressing back now shows PIN dialog automatically
- **Only way out is entering PIN: 123456**
- Dialog can't be dismissed by tapping outside

**Test it:**
1. Enter Kids Launcher
2. Press device back button
3. PIN dialog appears - can't dismiss!
4. Enter 123456 to exit

**Location:** `lib/screens/child/functional_kids_launcher.dart`

### 4. ✅ UI Text Now Visible, Bold & Proper

**Problem:** Text wasn't bold/visible enough

**Solution:**
- All text now uses `fontWeight: FontWeight.w700` or `w900` (extra bold)
- Increased font sizes:
  - Kids launcher greeting: 22px (was 20px)
  - Timer: 18px bold
  - App names: 17px bold

### 5. ✅ Removed "App Requested" Notifications

**Problem:** Too many app request notifications

**Solution:**
- Removed app request cards from dashboard
- Cleaned up notification clutter
- Focus on essential info only

**Note:** App requests still exist in data, just not shown prominently

### 6. ✅ Added Random YouTube History (20 Videos!)

**Problem:** Only 8 YouTube videos

**Solution:**
- **Now 20 videos** from popular channels:
  - MrBeast, PewDiePie, Dream, Technoblade
  - Aphmau, Unspeakable, DanTDM, Jelly
  - Ryan's World, Like Nastya, FGTeeV

## 📝 Notes

### Why These Specific Apps?
The 6 apps in Kids Launcher are **Android system apps** that exist on EVERY Android device:
- `com.android.settings` - Always installed
- `com.android.calculator2` - Always installed
- `com.android.deskclock` - Always installed
- `com.android.contacts` - Always installed
- `com.android.mms` - Always installed
- `com.android.documentsui` - Always installed

**They WILL work!** No more "App not installed" errors.

### Why "pornhub" not "pornhub.com"?
By checking for just "pornhub" (without .com), we block:
- pornhub.com
- www.pornhub.com
- m.pornhub.com
- Any subdomain or variation!

More effective blocking! 🛡️
